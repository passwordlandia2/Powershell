#This whole repository is a small test of my powershell scripts I practiced on my own to try to get better at writing code.
#Some practice examples include if/else statements, functions a fun Star Wars lightsaber adventure and a couple of small practice problems.
#Enjoy and hope I get to only get better and better at it, but I have moved into trying to in tandem learn Python as well.
