#In the above I set several lightsaber colors to arrays so that it would choose one automatically for the user regardless of what they put, to simulate determining their color and an output of words that are based around this.
#My attempt was to have a little fun with if else statements and functions combined so that someone's "destiny" can be randomized by just using the Get-Random of every color combined to get an output.
