#The script below uses a function that when called with the same name will output three different greetings, but it's also a fun take on Hello World but with functions and Star Wars.

#The premise of this is that the person speaking is an old fool who can't remember anything simple like your name because they're overly cautious but also because they are really distrustful.

#I was practicing starting and stopping greetings and text with Read-Host as well.
